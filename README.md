Steps to Setup Backend with Node and Express:
Step 1: Creating express app:

npm init -y

Step 2: Installing the required packages

npm install express mongoose body-parser

The updated dependencies in package.json file for backend will look like:

"dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.20.2",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.0.0",
}
Approach to create backend:
Create MongoDB Models:
Design MongoDB models for `Appointment`, `Doctor`, and `Patient` in separate files (`Appointment.js`, `Doctor.js`, `Patient.js`).
Set Up Express Routes:
Create separate routes for appointments, doctors, and patients (`appointments.js`, `doctors.js`, `patients.js`).
Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each resource.
Connect to MongoDB:
In your main `server.js`, connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
Donâ€™t forget to handle connection errors.

 Steps to Setup Frontend with React
Step 1: Create React App:

Step 2: Switch to the project directory:

cd myapp
Step 3: Installing the required packages:

npm install axios react-router-dom

The updated dependencies in package.json for frontend will look like:

"dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.5.1",

}
Approach to create Frontend:
Create Components for `Appointments`, `Doctors`, `Patients`, `AppointmentCard`, `DoctorCard`, and `PatientCard` within `src/components`
Create a main `App` component that utilizes React Router for navigation.
Design styles for each component to enhance the visual appeal.
